# ArchaeoDate

ArchaeoDate is a CLI for easily converting between the two commonly used archaeological date formats, BP (before present) and BC/AD. 

## Installation

Archaeodate is provided as a executable file to be run from the terminal. Simply download the correct file for you system and run the file.

For easy of use you may wish to create an alias to the location of the file.

## Useage

There are two components to any date: a number and a date system.

For example, 2000 BC has the number 2000 and the system BC, which stands for Before Christ.

To convert between BP and BC/AD enter a number into the number entry field and the two letter abbreviation of the system into the system field. The abbreviations are not case sensative.

CE and BCE are also suported, however the output will allways be in BC/AD.
